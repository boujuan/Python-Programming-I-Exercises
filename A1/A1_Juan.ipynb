    "\n",
    "Therefore, for checking purposes, we can use the following code, which compares the precision by using the numpy library, which offer arguably better and more precise power and summation algorithms, the decimal library, which increases the decimal precision to a fixed point, and the standard procedure. As can be observed, the best approach is numpy+decimal prcision followed by just decimal precision, using numpy and standard procedure, in fact, numpy does improve the results slightly but is still not as precise as merely increaasing the decimal precision.\n",

    "However, the geometric series method is still a much superior method to the power sum calculation method in terms of both precision, computation speed and simplicity, because it's a closed form of a geometric series function, so it doesn't rely on loops or external power and summation algorithms, which involve an increasing number of calculations for each value of k as N grows, that are susceptible to limited precision rounding error and are also computationally less efficient. However, even this method shows innacuracies when dealing with floating point numbers."

    "If the noise levels are too high, or if the number of data points is too small, the OLS method may not be able to accurately represent the relationship between the variables. Therefore several changes can be done to increase the accuracy of this method in order to get closer to the original function:\n",

Akin to the **'Monte Carlo simulation method'**, by repeating for a large number of iterations both the generation of points and the calculation of the coefficients, the impact of random noise can be reduced.\n",
